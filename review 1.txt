Review 1 45 mins - until 2:30 then show and tell
========
Ask the user to enter a guess until they get it right (integer between 0 and 100)
  from random import randint # this is a good way to make a random number
  n = randint(0,100)

If it's too high or too low tell them
When they get it right the game ends
(NB validate that an integer was entered) 

Optional
--------
tell them how many gueses they took
entering -1 quits the game (tell them the answer)
entering -2 offers hints: is it even, is it odd, is it a square or prime number?
maybe ask the user for the range (i.e. thedifficulty)

Recomended
- use if __name__ == '__main__'
- use functions
- use booleans to check if the game is over
- no expectation to use import just yet
