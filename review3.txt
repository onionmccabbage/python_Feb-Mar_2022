Python Review Exercise 3 
========================
We need a 'Weather' class
Decide on properties and methods you think it should encapsulate, then build it
Consider if there should be any read-only properties
Override the __str__ method so it prints nicely
Exercise the code by instantiating some weather objects
(remember to use if __name__...)

Details: carry on to 2:45
--------
Properties might include:
- city (read-only non-empty string of at least 2 letters)
- country code (read-only non-empty string of 2-3 letters)
- description (read-writable non-empty string such as 'sunny', 'rainy' etc.)
- temperature (read-writable floating point number)
Methods might include:
- Temperature in Kelvin: add 273 to the Celcius temperature
- Capitalize: return a property with initial capital letters
Make use of @property decorators and __ name mangling
Write a __str__ method that returns a nicely formatted report of the weather
Make sure the temperature is shown with 2 decimal places

Optional:
---------
Validate the country code to be one of a tuple of permitted values
- consider how to deal wioth ivalid values - defaults? leave unchaged? throw exception....?
  e.g. ('ie', 'fr', 'de', 'aus', 'gb') (maybe have a 'location' class for city/country)
Also add properties for wind-speed and direction (maybe as a dictionary or a 'wind' class)
Additional methods might include:
- commit to file: write the weather instance values to a text file (named for the city/country)
- retrieve from file: read back the values into a new weather instance (maybe ask which country)
Import your class into another module which asks the user for values to populate a weather instance

If Time:
--------
Extend your class into a 'CurrentWeather' class, which adds a date-time stamp to the weather
Exercise this new class to create several weather reports for a given location at different times
Handle exceptions elegantly
